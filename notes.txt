Terminal 1: cganarch wasserstein lr 5e-5    - seems to be doing okay, going to continue training
Terminal 2: cganarch wasserstein lr 1e-4    - seems to be doing okay, going to continue training
Terminal 3: cganarch least squares lr 1e-4  - did not work, model collapsed
Terminal 4: cganarch least squares lr 0.001 - did not work, model collapsed

All batch size 16
All celeba
All size 64x64

Looks like least squares with the cganarch did not work at all. Going to change the size
from 64x64 to 256x256 and continue training wasserstein

------------------------------------------- 

NOW:

Continuing top two wasserstein at 256x256
colorarch least squares lr 1e-4
colorarch least squares lr 0.001

All batch size 16
All celeba 
All 256x256
