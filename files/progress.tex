\section{Objectives}
Our objectives given in the project proposal are stated below. 

\noindent (1) Implement the state of the art[1] for image colorization. \newline
\noindent (2) Implement Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)[3]. \newline
\noindent (3) Implement Energy-Based Generative Adversarial Networks (EBGANs).[2] \newline
\noindent (4) Explore methods to pretrain the model used in 1 and fine tune it as a generator in 2 and 3.
\newline
\noindent (5) Time permitting, develop our own GAN architecture for comparison. \newline

\noindent Jahidul: 1, 4, 5 \newline
\noindent Cameron: 2, 3, 5 \newline

\noindent Cameron has implemented an adversarial network similar to the architecture used in [6]. Our model
is capable of using a combination of multiple loss functions. These include the typical L1 and L2 losses,
as well as various types of adversarial losses, such as the Wasserstein GAN [7] and the Least Squares GAN
[8].

\noindent Jahidul has implemented the Colorful Colorization network shown in [1] using L2 and L1 loss function. The original paper also implemented their own loss function, which is a major contribution to their work. Jahidul is currently implementing that loss function. We expect an improved colorization performance of the model using their customized loss function.

\noindent Both of these have been trained and tested on the CelebA dataset [5]. Samples are shown below.

\section{To Do}
We still have a number of things to test, such as pretraining the generator, implementing Energy-Based GANs,
combining the loss function in [1] with GAN loss, and training on multiple classes. While some of our results
show good performance on one class, we are uncertain how this will scale to multiple classes.
