\section{Introduction}
Talk about general colorization, what GANs are, maybe some related work, etc

\section{Problem}

for colorizing a black and white photo, not just one answer, but many plausible ones.

\section{Objectives}
Our approach, then finally what we are going to be doing individually.

\section{Timeframe}
Goals to achieve by certain dates.
