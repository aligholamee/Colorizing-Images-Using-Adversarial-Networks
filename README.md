# Colorizing-Images-Using-Adversarial-Networks
Colorizing images using an adversarial network approach.

Basically do what I did with the other colorization thing,
but after it's colorized, send it to the other network along
with the true color image, and have the adversary determine
which one is the true image and which one was colored by the
network.
